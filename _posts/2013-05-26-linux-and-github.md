## Linux

last Thursday, I installed Ubuntu (Linux) in my laptop. I always feel curious about those technologies. Linux is good, but it's a little difficult for me. The statistical package, R, is also based on linux. That is another reason I transfered form Windows to Linux. 

## Github and Jekyll

I have heard about github for many days. I know that it is for the code repositories. Besides that, I know nothing about it. So after installing Linux, I installed github. It will make my work more efficient. I will learn a lot from those geeks. 

Even in 2004, I have tried to build my blog. But I'm so lazy, the lives of my blogs cannot be longer than one year. I know that blog could be build on github with Jekyll. So I tried to build my blog. This time I met so many difficulties. those codes made me confused. I am frustrated. At last, I forked a repository from [hueidou] (https://github.com/hueidou) and make some revises. It worked. It is what you are reading on the screen.

## Sociology and Statistics

I will try to write something about sociology and statistics on this blog. I hated those simple-minded and stupid "quantitative studies". I want to make something different. Besides that, I will make some writing about my life and my reading on Github. Those will become different repositories.

Welcome, New blogger!
