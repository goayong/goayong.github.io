## chaos of Gini Coefficients
The pulbication of gini coefficient always arouse fury in China. In the last December, Chinese household financial survey claimed that gini coefficient has increased to 0.61. This is a bomb in academic circle and in press. A lot of newsparper reported this news. A month later, Chinese statisticl bureau published the gini coefficient between 2003 to 2012. The number ranged between 0.47 to 0.49. My questions is:  Is gini coefficient so important ? what 's the real implication of gini coefficient ?
